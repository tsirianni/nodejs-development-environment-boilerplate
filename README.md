# Backend Development Environment Boilerplate

This repository is a boilerplate for new nodejs projects, offering basic but necessary configuration to ensure code quality and format. This repository contitutes the following libraries:

### Linters for code quality

- [X] eslint
- [X] eslint-config-prettier
- [X] eslint-config-node

### Code style and Formatting
- [X] prettier

### Pre-commit hooks
- [X] husky
- [X] lint-staged

> [!NOTE]
> There is also a custom logger made from scratch based on `console.log` but with a few more configuration options and colors. Feel free to use it, modify it or remove it if you prefer a proper library such as PINO or WINSTON.
